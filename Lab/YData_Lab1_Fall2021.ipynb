    "\n",
    "Most class meeting times will include a lecture portion and a lab portion. This is an example of a lab for behavioral analysis using public data. The purpose of the labs is to give you hands-on experience using the skills from the main YData course (S&DS 123/523) while working within a particular domain. For this course, the focus is on analyzing possible behavioral impacts under the current pandemic, COVID-19!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, there are some details for the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I highly recommend to go through the [Practice 01 questions](http://ydata123.org/sp19/calendar.html) on the main YData website first, which explains Jupyter Notebook's setup. \n",
    "* This lab covers parts of [Chapter 3](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html) of the online textbook. If you are not familiar with any expression below, this can be a good reference!\n",
    "* I encourage group collaboration on the course labs. If you get stuck for a while on a question, feel free to ask your classmates (or email me for help if needed). Please do take some time to think by yourself first and do not just share answers to each other though. "
