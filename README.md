**YData_SDS177/577** 

Welcome to this connector course! This is where you can find all our course notes for Spring 2021 SDS177/577 (YData: COVID-19 Behavioral Impacts).

The datasets (given the limited size of files in GitHub) can be accessed through the following Google Drive link:<br />
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SLPLMpgdzcn79iMBOYhh9CmOZaw7odpE <br />
The datasets are for teaching purpose only. Please do not share the datasets with others unless you receive my permission.

Our lecture notes will be updated under the **Lecture** folder, our in-class (online) practice questions will be updated under the  **Labs** folder, and our homework questions will be updated under the **Homework** folder. We will have 12 labs and 4 homework assignments. Note that each homework contains 3 major questions, corresponding to questions in 3 lab's materials. Please go through the lab questions first (if you miss the class or so) when you do your homework. 

I will update the discussion site on Piazza when the course is fully online.
